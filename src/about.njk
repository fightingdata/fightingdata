                FightingData.com is a UFC analytics platform built for people who want to understand matchups through data, not hot takes. Every time a fight card is announced, we generate head-to-head statistical breakdowns for every matchup on the card — striking, grappling, control, finishing tendencies — so you can form your own opinions grounded in real numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                We don't sell picks. We don't predict winners. We present the data clearly and let you draw your own conclusions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How It Works</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When you open a fighter comparison, you'll see two tables: career statistics and recent performance. Career stats cover every UFC fight a fighter has had since November 2000. Recent performance focuses on their most recent bouts to capture current form — because a fighter's last few outings often tell a different story than their career averages.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Edge indicators highlight which fighter has the statistical advantage in each category. These aren't predictions — they're a quick visual guide to where each fighter's strengths and vulnerabilities lie relative to their opponent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                We break analysis into three areas: <strong class="text-white">striking</strong> (accuracy, volume, defense, knockdowns), <strong class="text-white">grappling</strong> (takedown accuracy vs. opponent's takedown defense, submission attempts, control time), and <strong class="text-white">finishing ability</strong> (KO rate, submission rate, and how fights typically end).
